## Hi there, I'm Jake 👋

I'm a Computer Science student who's interested in a range of interesting fields applicable to software engineering.

### What I'm up to

- 👨🏻‍💻 Studying [BSc(Hons) in Computer Science at the University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate-2022/computer-science/bsc-computer-science/#course-structure)
- 🛠 Working on [my website](https://jakedavies.dev), and our [_Experimental Systems Project_](https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2021-2022/cm/CM20314.html)
- 🎮 Playing Pokemon Legends: Arceus, and Spiderman: Miles Morales
- 🌟 I love compilers, comparative programming languages, HCI, machine learning and more
